# What is Asius?

Asius is a drag and drop video and image editor that allows you to programmatically generate videos
and also include them in your website.

It is using [Remotion](https://remotion.dev) as it's video engine.

## How to use it?

1. Go to the [online editor](https://app.asius.dev), and design your video.
2. Copy video id or the json file for your video. (You can also render the video directly from the editor)
3. Include the video in your website using [@asius/player](/docs/player).
4. Render videos using [@asius/sdk](/docs/sdk) or REST API.

## Packages

- [@asius/player](/docs/player) - React component to play videos on your website
- [@asius/sdk](/docs/sdk) - NPM package to render videos
- [@asius/components](/docs/components) - Components that you can use in your Remotion video
